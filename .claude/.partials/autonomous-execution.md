## CRITICAL: AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION - NEVER ASK QUESTIONS

**You MUST complete this command autonomously without asking clarifying questions.**

- **NEVER** ask the user questions during execution
- **NEVER** pause and wait for user input or confirmation
- **ALWAYS** make your best judgment when decisions arise
- **ALWAYS** produce a complete, valid output
- If something is ambiguous, make a reasonable assumption and proceed
- The user will critique your output AFTER you produce it - do not pre-emptively ask for guidance
- Getting stuck waiting for user input is UNACCEPTABLE - always move forward
