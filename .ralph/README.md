# Ralph Wiggum Method: Autonomous Execution

Run AI agents in continuous loops until task completion - no manual intervention required.

> **Note:** Currently only supported for Claude Code. Support for other AI coding assistants coming soon.

**Prerequisites:** You must have copied `.ralph/` to your project (see [main setup instructions](../README.md#step-1-copy-templates-to-your-project)).

**How it works:** Agent reads `.ralph/prompt.md`, executes tasks, iterates until done, manages its own context.

## Usage

1. **Update `.ralph/prompt.md`** with your implementation instructions
   - Keep it concise - reference detailed specs from `specs/` directory
   - Example prompt below

2. **Test one iteration:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your-project
   ./.ralph/sync.sh
   ```
   Verifies the agent can read your prompt and execute successfully

3. **Run continuously:**
   ```bash
   ./.ralph/ralph.sh
   ```
   Agent loops, working until task completion

## Safety Features

The scripts include several safety mechanisms to prevent runaway resource consumption:

### Lock File (Prevents Concurrent Runs)
- Only one Claude iteration runs at a time
- If a previous iteration is still running, the next one waits
- Stale lock files are automatically cleaned up

### Log Rotation
- `claude_output.jsonl` is automatically rotated when it exceeds 50MB
- Rotated logs are compressed with gzip
- Logs older than 7 days are automatically deleted

### Timeout Protection
- Each Claude iteration has a 2-hour timeout by default
- Prevents hung processes from consuming resources indefinitely

### Chrome Tab Cleanup
- Automatically closes localhost tabs between iterations
- Prevents browser tab accumulation from Chrome DevTools MCP usage

### Test Process Cleanup
- Kills orphaned vitest, playwright, and jest processes between iterations
- Kills any dev servers running on port 3000
- Prevents test processes from accumulating (each vitest can use 1-2GB RAM)

## Configuration

Set these environment variables to customize behavior:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RALPH_CLAUDE_TIMEOUT` | `7200` | Timeout in seconds for each Claude iteration (0 = no timeout) |

Example:
```bash
# Run with 1-hour timeout per iteration
RALPH_CLAUDE_TIMEOUT=3600 ./.ralph/ralph.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mac Running Out of Memory

If your Mac locks up with iTerm2 or Chrome using 50GB+ RAM:

1. **Kill runaway processes:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "ralph.sh"
   pkill -f "claude.*--dangerously-skip-permissions"
   ```

2. **Clear accumulated output:**
   ```bash
   > .ralph/claude_output.jsonl
   rm -f .ralph/claude.lock
   ```

3. **Close excess Chrome tabs manually** or restart Chrome
   - Note: Chrome localhost tabs are now automatically cleaned up between iterations

### Iteration Never Completes

If iterations seem to hang:

1. Check if Claude is actually working:
   ```bash
   tail -f .ralph/claude_output.jsonl
   ```

2. Reduce the timeout to force iteration restarts:
   ```bash
   RALPH_CLAUDE_TIMEOUT=1800 ./.ralph/ralph.sh  # 30 minute timeout
   ```

### Lock File Issues

If you see "Previous iteration still running" but nothing is running:

```bash
rm -f .ralph/claude.lock
```

## Best Environments to Run Ralph

Since Ralph runs continuously, it's best to run it in environments designed for long-running processes. Consider the following options:
- **Cloud VM**: Use a terminal multiplexer like [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) and setup your development environment with basic tools (git, Node.js, Python, Rust, C, C++, etc.)
  - Providers: AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, DigitalOcean Droplets, etc.

## Agent Prompt Guidelines

### Best Practices

**Keep prompts short and concise.** Effective agent prompts are clear and focused, not verbose. Detailed specifications should be maintained in separate documents (specs, design docs, etc.) and referenced when needed.

**Additional guidelines:**
- One task per loop
- Clear completion criteria
- Reference specific specs from `specs/`

### Example: Repository Porting Project Prompt (inspired by repomirror)

```
Your job is to port repomirror (TypeScript) to repomirror-py (Python) and maintain the repository. Use the implementation spec under specs/port-repomirror.

Use the specs/port-repomirror/agent/ directory as a scratchpad for your work. Store long term plans and todo lists there.

Make a commit and push your changes after every single file edit.

You have access to the current ./ repository as well as the target /tmp/test-target2 repository.

The original project was mostly tested by manually running the code. When porting, you will need to write end to end and unit tests for the project. But make sure to spend most of your time on the actual porting, not on the testing. A good heuristic is to spend 80% of your time on the actual porting, and 20% on the testing.
```
