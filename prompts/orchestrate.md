# Task

Your job is to determine the place to pick up work for a work item according to an execution workflow. It is possible that no work has been done, and it is possible that work is in-progress and should be resumed where it left off.

You will use the `assignment.json` file (located in the same directory as the `execute.md` workflow) to track the work item that is in progress. The assignment file path is: `{{assignment_path}}`. If this file does not exist, it means that no work has been done. If this file exists, it means that work MIGHT be in-progress, and you must assess where to pick up work from.
